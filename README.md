Alien Invaders Game

Overview

This project involves creating a game called Alien Invaders using Python. The game integrates MediaPipe and OpenCV to utilize hand motion detection for gameplay control, providing a modern and interactive gaming experience.

Features

Real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe.

Motion-based controls for an immersive gameplay experience.

Smooth integration of computer vision with traditional game development.

User-friendly interface and responsive controls.

Technology Stack

Python: Core programming language.

MediaPipe: Hand gesture recognition and motion tracking.

OpenCV: Real-time image processing.

Pygame: Game development framework for 2D game mechanics.

Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone this repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd alien-invaders

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the game:

python alien_invaders.py

Use hand gestures (e.g., swipe left/right, open/close fist) to control the game.

How It Works

MediaPipe: Detects hand landmarks and tracks motion in real-time.

OpenCV: Captures video input and processes frames for gesture recognition.

Game Logic: Uses Pygame to manage alien movements, player controls, and collision detection.

Future Enhancements

Add support for additional gestures.

Introduce new game levels and challenges.

Optimize performance for better real-time responsiveness.
